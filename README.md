# Pothole-Detection-and-Road-Damage-Assessment
this project employs advanced segmentation techniques and leverages a YOLOv8 model trained on custom datasets to accurately measure and calculate pothole-affected areas. This innovative approach sets it apart from conventional methods, which typically focus on detecting and counting potholes without considering their spatial extent.
