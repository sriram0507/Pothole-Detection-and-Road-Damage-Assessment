# Pothole-Detection-and-Road-Damage-Assessment
this project employs advanced segmentation techniques and leverages a YOLOv8 model trained on custom datasets to accurately measure and calculate pothole-affected areas. This innovative approach sets it apart from conventional methods, which typically focus on detecting and counting potholes without considering their spatial extent. Furthermore, the project introduces a novel route-ranking method based on road damage severity and pothole presence, providing valuable insights for road safety enhancement and maintenance prioritization. By harnessing the power of image processing and deep learning technologies, this project aims to significantly improve road safety, enhance maintenance methods, and strengthen the resilience of urban environments.
